# **SplashApp**

## Splash is an Android mobile application designed as a flashcard memorisation tool for students.

## It works by looping through a series of test questions aimed at testing Java skills. 

## The questions can be personalised and used interchangably as they are compiled using a JSON file.

## The questions are loaded into the app and displayed onto the screen using setQuestionScreen() and LoadJSONArray().

## The app loops through each interaction with the user via the onClick() event listener on each button.

## Each iteration keeps a count of correct/ incorrect answers as it loops through each object 10 times.

## Finally when the loop has finished parsing through the JSONArray it displays the counted result as a tally on the screen.
